Audio Essentials: Introduction
--

In this repository, I have assembled a selection of audio programming examples, in the form of open-source projects that represent the past 25 years (or even more) in the development of audio software. These projects fall into the following categories:

1. Audio Files
    a. libsndfile
2. Audio Device Interfaces
	a. Portaudio
	b. ASIO
3. Oscillators and Filters
    a.
    b.
4. Audio Analysis Tools
    a. FFTW
    b. Sonic Visualizer?
4. Effect Plug-ins
    a. VST
    b. AU
5. Sequencers
6. Audio Editors
7. Synthesis Engines
8. Game Engines

I'll initially collect repositories that interest me as submodules. Then, as I study them, I will add my notes.
